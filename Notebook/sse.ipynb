Injunctions — Distinctions Abolished — Code Practice — Interpretation of Statutes.\\nUnder our Code practice the difference between special and common injunctions has been abolished, and they are ancillary to the relief sought in the actioh, and dependent upon service of process upon the defendant therein in accordance with the modes recognized by statute.\\n2. Injunctions — Bills and Notes — Banks and Banking — Nonresident Defendant — Process—Attachment.\\nWhere the maker of a note brings his action against a nonresident payee to impeach his note upon the ground of fraud or false representations in its procurement, and seeks an injunction restraining the payee from further negotiating it, and a resident bank, where it had been deposited, from parting with its possession, it is necessary to show personal service of the summons on the nonresident defendant or his duly authorized agent, or some act of his amounting to a waiver thereof; and the issuance of the restraining order on the bank, depending upon proper service of process on the payee, will likewise be dismissed where a special appearance has been entered for that purpose, and there has been no service or waiver of process by the nonresident defendant. The remedy is by attachment of the note in the hands of the bank, under the provisions of Revisal, sec. 777, and publication of notice to the nonresident defendant based thereon. Bernhardt v. Brown, 118 N. C., 701, cited and applied.\\nAppeal by plaintiff from Whedbee, J., at October Term, 1913, of CRAVEN.\\nErnest M. Green for plaintiff.\\nCharles R. Thomas for defendants.',\n",

Under tbe system of procedure prior to tbe adoption of The Code, injunctions were special or common.

He entered a special appearance and asked to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the proceeding. This is not a proceeding in rem to enforce any lien upon the property or to make partition thereof.

An injunction granted before the issuing of a summons is irregular and will be vacated on motion. McArthur v. McEachin, 64 N. C., 72; Hirsh v. Whitehead, 65 N. C., 516. For a stronger reason, it must be vacated when no summons has been served on Kinsell and jurisdiction has not been acquired either by attachment -or by the court being in control of the res.\\nThe injunction, therefore, was properly dismissed- as to Ein-sell and also as to the bank,* because as to the latter no cause of action was stated in the absence of the defendant Einsell. We see no advantage to the plaintiff in an injunction against the bank nor even as against Einsell, which cannot be had by the attachment' when procured. Moreover, an injunction as to a nonresident is improvident, for it can have no effect — usually, at least — except in personam. Warlick v. Reynolds, 151 N.

Injunctions — Distinctions Abolished — Code Practice — Interpretation of Statutes.\\nUnder our Code practice the difference between special and common injunctions has been abolished, and they are ancillary to the relief sought in the actioh, and dependent upon service of process upon the defendant therein in accordance with the modes recognized by statute.\\n2. Injunctions — Bills and Notes — Banks and Banking — Nonresident Defendant — Process—Attachment.\\nWhere the maker of a note brings his action against a nonresident payee to impeach his note upon the ground of fraud or false representations in its procurement, and seeks an injunction restraining the payee from further negotiating it, and a resident bank, where it had been deposited, from parting with its possession, it is necessary to show personal service of the summons on the nonresident defendant or his duly authorized agent, or some act of his amounting to a waiver thereof; and the issuance of the restraining order on the bank, depending upon proper service of process on the payee, will likewise be dismissed where a special appearance has been entered for that purpose, and there has been no service or waiver of process by the nonresident defendant. The remedy is by attachment of the note in the hands of the bank, under the provisions of Revisal, sec. 777, and publication of notice to the nonresident defendant based thereon. Bernhardt v.
